# EASbrowse (Windows only)
a simple EAS scenario browser and sound player
The files were downloaded and converted to .wav for simplicity

This project uses the same recursive system to display a menu as used in my rock-paper-scissors project. 

## How to use
download the release, click the exe and have fun, or, git clone and build yourself, also feel free to add more eas scenarios to the list!
